# Elevation map and rivers in Cundinamarca, Colombia

The associated R script was produced as part of an independent consulting study in 2024, which aimed to determine the optimal railway route connecting Bogot√° and the Magdalena River in Colombia. The elevation data was processed by an algorithm to navigate the ~2,200-meter descent between the two locations while adhering to strict constraints for slope, height, and track radius. The resulting map was for illustrative purposes only.

The processed elevation data was then used by a separate path-finding algorithm (not included in this script) to calculate the optimal route.
